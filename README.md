# RavagerAI â€” Prompt Library (scaffold)

This repository is a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold for a prompt library/landing page inspired by shadcn UI.

What's included

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS configured
- A simple Home landing page and a Prompts page that loads local JSON prompts

Quick start (macOS, zsh)

1. Install dependencies

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

2. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173

Notes

- This is a starter scaffold. To fully use shadcn components, install @radix-ui and shadcn/ui packages and follow their setup. The UI here is built with Tailwind tokens similar to shadcn styles.
- Prompts are stored in `src/prompts/prompts.json` for demo purposes.
